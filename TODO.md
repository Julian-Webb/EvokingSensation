# General Points
* save settings to file so they are the same next time
* Maybe add validation to the pulse widths. The total pulse (plus a bit of extra width) mustn't be longer than the period. But this is really an edge case. You wouldn't actually configure this in a real experiment. The pulse is generally way shorter than the period!
* Stop stimulation if window is closed

* The channel should be moved to the stimulation buttons

* delete azure theme
